//ï‚§	Create a class called Worker. Write classes DailyWorker and 
//SalariedWorker that inherit from Worker. Every worker has a name and a 
//salary. Write method pay() to compute the week pay of every worker.  
//A Daily worker is paid on the basis of the number of days she/he works. 
//The salaried worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what
//the actual worked hours are.  Create a few different types of workers and
//print all the details of  the workers(name, salary and D/W (indicating 
//		the type of worker)) in sorted order of the salary.
